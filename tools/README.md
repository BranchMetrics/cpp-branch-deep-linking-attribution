# CPPLINT
https://github.com/cpplint/cpplint/blob/master/cpplint.py

This is a forked (and maintained) version of Google's cpplint.

# stage.py
Called from rmake.bat to collect Poco headers and libraries for MSI packaging.

# build_wix.py

Run manually after any build to regenerate `BranchSDK\Windows\BranchInstaller\Components.wxs`
based on output of stage.py. This generates changes to be committed. Run from this directory.

```
> cd BranchSDK\tools
> python build_wix.py
```

# component-ids.json

Used and generated by build_wix.py to ensure consistent UUIDs for components from build to
build. Can also be imported into the build_wix.py script from the existing Components.wxs at
runtime.

# version_bump.py

Performs a version bump throughout the repo, updating source code, packaging &amp; example apps.
The new version must be supplied at the command line. Suffixes such as `-beta.1` are supported.

```
> cd BranchSDK\tools
> python version_bump.py 1.2.2-beta.1
```
